## Hello!

I'm Patrick, a current MSc AI and Data Science Student at the University of Hull. 

My Github account is where I store my personal projects completed outside of University, hoping to practice and showcase some skills in particular areas of interest!

My backgroud is mostly in Agriculture, so naturally my first projects had an agriultural focus. I was a Juniour Wheat Breeder before undetaking my Masters, so my expertise and knowledge lended themselves fittingly to my initial projects.

My goal is to create a diverse range of projects encasing all aspects of what I'm learning on my course, across a range of subject areas. 

Any questions please get in touch!
